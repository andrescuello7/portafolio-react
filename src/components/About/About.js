                    <div>began my career as a frontend developer in the 2020 year and have slowly over time taken on a more web based technical front-end developer role. work in details that many frontend developers tend to overlook. Being a hybrid frontend dev and technician with knowledge in digital content allows me to fill two roles simultaneously, which in todayâ€™s economy can be very beneficial to any company. Having studied at Coder house and done real projects has given me a wealth of knowledge and a diverse skill set to be able to tackle any development project that comes my way.</div>
